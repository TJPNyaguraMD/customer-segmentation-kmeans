# Customer Segmentation Analysis: E-commerce Marketing Strategy

### Leveraging K-Means Clustering for Targeted Customer Insights

---

##  Project Overview

In this project, I perform a comprehensive customer segmentation analysis for a UK-based online retail company. By applying unsupervised machine learning techniques to transactional data, I aim to identify distinct customer groups based on their purchasing behavior.

Understanding customer segments allows businesses to move from a "one-size-fits-all" marketing approach to personalized strategies that improve customer retention, increase average order value (AOV), and optimize marketing spend.

##  Dataset Information

The dataset used is the **Online Retail II** dataset from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/502/online+retail+ii).

* **Timeline:** Transactions occurring between 01/12/2009 and 09/12/2011.
* **Context:** The company primarily sells unique all-occasion gift-ware. Many customers are wholesalers.
* **Key Statistics:** * **Instances:** 525,461
* **Features:** Invoice number, Stock code, Description, Quantity, Invoice date, Unit price, Customer ID, and Country.



##  Business Objectives

1. **Data Engineering:** Transform raw transactional data into a customer-centric **RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary)** framework.
2. **Customer Understanding:** Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to find trends in sales, geography, and top-selling products.
3. **Machine Learning:** Implement a **K-Means Clustering** algorithm to segment customers.
4. **Strategic Recommendations:** Interpret the clusters to provide actionable business recommendations for marketing and sales teams.

## Technical Workflow

1. **Data Cleaning:** Handling missing values (specifically Customer IDs) and removing cancellations/returns to ensure data integrity.
2. **RFM Feature Engineering:**
* **Recency:** Days since the last purchase.
* **Frequency:** Total number of purchases.
* **Monetary Value:** Total revenue generated by the customer.


3. **Pre-processing:** Scaling features using `StandardScaler` to handle the variance in RFM metrics and addressing skewness.
4. **Optimal Cluster Selection:** Utilizing the **Elbow Method** and **Silhouette Score** to determine the most effective number of clusters ().
5. **Cluster Profiling:** Visualizing clusters using 3D scatter plots and snake plots to define "Champions," "At-Risk," and "New Customers."

## Project Conclusion: Customer Segmentation of Online Retail II

This project successfully transformed over one million raw transactions from the **Online Retail II** dataset into a high-impact, customer-centric segmentation strategy. By combining unsupervised machine learning (-Means) with advanced outlier profiling, I identified seven distinct customer groups that enable data-driven marketing decisions.

###  Key Methodological Achievements

* **Data Integrity:** Implemented a robust cleaning pipeline to handle negative quantities (returns), missing customer identifiers, and non-product stock codes like "POSTAGE," ensuring the final analysis was based on genuine purchase behavior.
* **Strategic Outlier Management:** Utilizing the Interquartile Range (IQR) method, I isolated extreme "Whales" (Clusters -1, -2, and -3) before training the model. This prevented the centroids from distorting and allowed for a highly accurate -Means model for the core retail population.
* **Mathematical Validation:** Optimized the clustering model () through the **Silhouette Score** and **Elbow Method**, validating that the resulting segments were statistically significant and well-separated in 3D space.

###  Business Impact and Behavioral Insights

#### 1. The Core Retail Segments (Clusters 0 to 3)

The analysis identified four key archetypes within the standard customer base:

* **Champions (Cluster 3):** The highest spenders and most frequent visitors. **Strategy:** VIP loyalty rewards.
* **Potential Loyalists (Cluster 0):** High recency and growing spend. **Strategy:** Cross-selling to increase purchase frequency.
* **Recent/Occasional (Cluster 2):** New shoppers with low frequency but high engagement. **Strategy:** Personalized welcome sequences.
* **At-Risk (Cluster 1):** Customers who have not visited in over 6 months. **Strategy:** Re-engagement campaigns with win-back discounts.

#### 2. The Elite Outlier Profiles (Clusters -1 to -3)

By profiling the outliers separately, I uncovered critical B2B and "Super-Shopper" segments:

* **PAMPER (Cluster -1):** High-ticket, infrequent spenders. **Focus:** Maintaining loyalty with luxury service.
* **UPSELL (Cluster -2):** Highly frequent buyers with **low monetary value** per order. **Focus:** Encouraging bundle deals and larger orders to optimize shipping costs.
* **DELIGHT (Cluster -3):** The most valuable "Dual Outliers" with extreme spend and frequency. **Focus:** Dedicated VIP account management.

###  Final Summary

This analysis proves that a one-size-fits-all marketing approach is inefficient. By leveraging **Violin Plots** to understand data density and **-Means** to define behavior, this project provides the business with a roadmap to maximize **Customer Lifetime Value (CLV)**. The distinction between "Whales" and "Retail Shoppers" ensures that marketing resources are allocated where they will generate the highest return on investment.
