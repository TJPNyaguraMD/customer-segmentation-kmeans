# Customer Segmentation Analysis: E-commerce Marketing Strategy

### Leveraging K-Means Clustering for Targeted Customer Insights

---

##  Project Overview

In this project, I perform a comprehensive customer segmentation analysis for a UK-based online retail company. By applying unsupervised machine learning techniques to transactional data, I aim to identify distinct customer groups based on their purchasing behavior.

Understanding customer segments allows businesses to move from a "one-size-fits-all" marketing approach to personalized strategies that improve customer retention, increase average order value (AOV), and optimize marketing spend.

##  Dataset Information

The dataset used is the **Online Retail II** dataset from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/502/online+retail+ii).

* **Timeline:** Transactions occurring between 01/12/2009 and 09/12/2011.
* **Context:** The company primarily sells unique all-occasion gift-ware. Many customers are wholesalers.
* **Key Statistics:** * **Instances:** 525,461
* **Features:** Invoice number, Stock code, Description, Quantity, Invoice date, Unit price, Customer ID, and Country.



##  Business Objectives

1. **Data Engineering:** Transform raw transactional data into a customer-centric **RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary)** framework.
2. **Customer Understanding:** Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to find trends in sales, geography, and top-selling products.
3. **Machine Learning:** Implement a **K-Means Clustering** algorithm to segment customers.
4. **Strategic Recommendations:** Interpret the clusters to provide actionable business recommendations for marketing and sales teams.

## Technical Workflow

1. **Data Cleaning:** Handling missing values (specifically Customer IDs) and removing cancellations/returns to ensure data integrity.
2. **RFM Feature Engineering:**
* **Recency:** Days since the last purchase.
* **Frequency:** Total number of purchases.
* **Monetary Value:** Total revenue generated by the customer.


3. **Pre-processing:** Scaling features using `StandardScaler` to handle the variance in RFM metrics and addressing skewness.
4. **Optimal Cluster Selection:** Utilizing the **Elbow Method** and **Silhouette Score** to determine the most effective number of clusters ().
5. **Cluster Profiling:** Visualizing clusters using 3D scatter plots and snake plots to define "Champions," "At-Risk," and "New Customers."
